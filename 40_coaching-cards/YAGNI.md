Too often we build features “just in case”. Let’s not. Every extra line is a maintenance liability. Keep your code lean, focused, and demand-driven.

- Writing utilities for future features.
- Adding configuration you don’t use.
- Designing for edge cases you haven’t even met.

Can you find a piece of code that was written “just in case” but never used?
