# 🛡️ Secure Software Engineering: Core Principles for Junior Developers

## 👩‍💻 Your Code = Your Responsibility

As a developer, you're not *just* writing features. You’re shaping the security posture of the entire system. These principles apply to *everyone*, regardless of experience level.

---

## 🔑 Principle 1: Least Privilege

**Give only the access that's truly needed.**  
- Never assume “read-only” is harmless.  
- Ask: *Who needs access? Why? For how long?*  
- Avoid exposing data to entire departments or organizations by default.

🔁 *Think in roles and scopes, not in convenience.*

---

## 🔒 Principle 2: Data is always sensitive

Even if data doesn’t look "confidential":
- It may be **useful to attackers** in aggregation.
- It could be **misused internally**.
- It may **become sensitive** through business changes.

🧠 *If you can't explain why data is safe to expose, don't expose it.*

---

## 🕵️ Principle 3: Auditability

Build systems that answer:
- *Who accessed this?*
- *When and why?*
- *Who changed what?*

🎯 Track changes with user IDs, timestamps, and tools like audit logs or event streams.

---

## 📦 Principle 4: Don’t ship raw data

Raw database access is rarely justified.
- Provide **structured APIs**, **filtered endpoints**, or **aggregated dashboards** instead.
- Keep internal data models **separated from external representations**.

🚪 *Your backend is not a data warehouse for everyone.*

---

## 🧱 Principle 5: Defense in depth

Security is not one checkbox — it’s a layered mindset:
- API authentication
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Logging & monitoring
- Controlled data exposure

💬 *Assume mistakes will happen — make sure they’re contained.*

---

## ✅ As a Junior, you should always:

- Ask questions like *"Do we really need this level of access?"*
- Challenge assumptions like *"It’s just internal, so it’s fine."*
- Learn the basics of **access control**, **data classification**, and **secure defaults**.
- Talk to your team or product owner if something feels off.

## 💡 Reminder

> **You don’t need to be a security expert to think securely.**  
> You just need to care — and ask the right questions.
