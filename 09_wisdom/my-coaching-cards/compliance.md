# Compliance – Not Just Bureaucracy!

Compliance rules aren't just annoying obstacles for people who get things done. They reflect what the owners (aka shareholders) want: a company that operates legally, with integrity, and protects its reputation.

If you're getting "creative" with the rules, you're not doing the company a favor – you're actually going against the interests of the owners. And they're the ones who give you your mandate in the first place.

Quick reality check: A compliance breach isn't a harmless slip-up. It's a breach of trust – with financial consequences. And that will catch up with you.
