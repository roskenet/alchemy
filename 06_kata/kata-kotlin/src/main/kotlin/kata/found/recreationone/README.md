# Integers: Recreation One

`1, 246, 2, 123, 3, 82, 6, 41` are the divisors of number `246`.

Squaring these divisors we get: `1, 60516, 4, 15129, 9, 6724, 36, 1681`.

The sum of these squares is `84100` which is `290 * 290`.

## Task

Find all integers between `m` and `n` (m and n are integers with 1 <= m <= n) such that the sum of their squared divisors is itself a square.

We will return an array of subarrays or of tuples (in C an array of Pair) or a string.

The subarrays (or tuples or Pairs) will have two elements: first the number the squared divisors of which is a square and then the sum of the squared divisors.

## Example:

```
m =  1, n = 250 --> [[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
m = 42, n = 250 --> [[42, 2500], [246, 84100]]
```

The form of the examples may change according to the language, see "Sample Tests".

## Note

In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.

```kotlin
package solution

import org.junit.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class SumSquaredDivisorsTest {
    
    @Test
    fun basicTests() {
        assertEquals("[[1, 1], [42, 2500], [246, 84100]]", SumSquaredDivisors.listSquared(1, 250))
        assertEquals("[[42, 2500], [246, 84100]]", SumSquaredDivisors.listSquared(42, 250))
        
    }      
}
