# Alchemy - My source of truth

This is a collection of examples, snippets and recipes on how I do things at Zalando and / or software engineering in general. There might be other ways to do it - but they are just wrong.

The projects are named after chemical elements in no particular order.
Every README contains keywords to grep for a particular solution.

There are other repositories that deploy to Zalando's playground cluster having their own deployment pipeline.
