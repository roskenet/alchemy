# Code by layers

“Organizing code by layers is like sorting LEGO bricks by color – it looks neat, but when you're trying to build a car, you can never find the damn wheels.”

“Instead, group your LEGOs by set – like firetruck, spaceship, or castle – so everything you need is in one place. That’s what feature-based architecture gives you.”
